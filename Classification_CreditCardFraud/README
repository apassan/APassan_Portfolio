# Predicing Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions

Goal: develop a classification model that can both explain and predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.

Data Source: Kaggle dataset consisting of 1,000,000 credit card transactions.


Models: Accuracy of final model for specified algorithm 
1. Logistic Regression: 94% 
2. K-Nearest Neighbors: 96%
3. Support Vector Machine: 99%
4. Decision Tree: 98%
5. Random Forest 99%

In this context, I would suggest going with the decision tree model as it has a high accuracy rate (along with precision and recall - please refer to the classifier4_dt.ipynb file) and it is a more interpretable model to explain to stakeholders regarding the decisions behind what makes a credit card transaction fraudulent. 


This project contains the following:

- 'data': A folder containing the raw dataset in CSV.
- 'scripts': A folder containing some helpful scripts to import the data for certain Jupyter Notebooks (JNs).
- 'prep': JN that imports the data and performs some quick sanity checks. 
- 'eda': JN that has some exploratory data analysis.
- 'classifier...': JNs that goes through different types of classification models and evaluates the best model of that specific algorithm.
