Intrigued by the idea of dance as one's reaction to listening to a song, my team and I wanted to investigate to what extent does the danceability of a song determine its overall popularity. Is the danceability of a song something artists, song producers, and songwriters should consider in composing a new song? 

To help answer this question, we conducted a multi-linear regression analysis using a dataset from Kaggle (originally retrieved from Spotify's Web API). In the end we had a final dataset of 586,672 songs to work with. 

This project contains the following:
- 'Presentation': The final presentation of our model and findings.
- 'w205_lab_spotify': The final report which goes into greater depth of the full regression analysis. There are two versions: pdf and R markdown. 
- 'src': This folder contains extra R scripts used.
