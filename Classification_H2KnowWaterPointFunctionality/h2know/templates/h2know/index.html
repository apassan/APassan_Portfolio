                   <!-- <p class="fst-italic">Qui laudantium consequatur laborum sit qui ad sapiente dila parde sonata raqer a videna mareta paulona marka</p> -->
					<p>
					  <u>XGBoost Algorithm</u>
					  <br>
					  H2knOw uses an <strong>XGBoost classification</strong> algorithm to predict whether a water point in question is functional. XGBoost is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weak decision tree learners to form a strong learner. Each new tree attempts to fix the errors of the trees already part of the model until no further improvements can be made.<sup><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-vishalmorde-xgboost-algorithm-long-she-may-rein-edd9f99be63d" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup><br>
					  <br>
					  As there are some water points that have multiple observations from different points in time, H2knOw uses XGBoost in the context of <strong>time series forecasting</strong> to predict water point functionality. An earlier observation of a water point provides helpful context to improve the prediction of the water point’s future functionality. Additionally, temporal attributes such as an observation’s month and day of month help the model extract any yearly or monthly trends that may affect functionality of a water point (e.g. in relation to dry season or any scheduled maintenance). <br>
					  <br>
					  <u>Considerations for COVID-19 Pandemic</u>
					  <br>
					  It should also be mentioned that the COVID-19 pandemic changed population behavior significantly, and directly impacted the development of time series in many domains because it led to unrepresentative values in data history, which in turn can hinder model learning<sup><a href="https://cienciadedatos.net/documentos/py45-weighted-time-series-forecasting.html" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>. This was also the case in developing the final H2knOw model.<br>
					  The three countries had their highest waves in COVID-19 cases in mid-2020, and in Summer and Winter 2021<sup><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/sierra-leone" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/nigeria" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/uganda" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>. This timeline affected the frequency of water point observations done during the pandemic.There was a drop in organizations collecting data on water points in 2020 (3,099 observations) and 2021 (4,965 observations) due to the pandemic. Data collection increased significantly in 2022 (17,907 observations) and 2023 (7,416 observations), indicating that much of the information being captured in these two years were a reflection of the large waves of the pandemic in the years just before, and which showed a changed population behavior. It is for this reason that H2KnOw decided to only incorporate data until 2021 in this proof of concept model.

                    <h3>Training & Testing</h3>
                    <p>Given this is a time series model, it was very important to ensure that the training, validation, and test data were split properly to avoid data leakage. The H2KnOw model was trained on water point observations taken from 2005 until 2020 (229,230 observations), and tested on observations from 2021 (4,965 observations); total 234,195 records including historical observations.<br>
						<br>
						A 5 fold cross validation with a time series split was used in training the XGBoost model. This means that for each fold, the training dataset (ordered by observation date) was split into a training and validation set by selecting a cut off point. Each successive cut off point moves forward in time. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<img src="{% static '/img/5cv.png'%}" class="img-fluid" alt="">
						<br>
						Data from 2021 was not included in the cross validation. It was held out as the final test set to evaluate our selected model on unseen data. <br>
						<br>
						<em>Note on model development:</em> the final model was developed via hyperparameter tuning with the help of grid search (which also incorporated a 5-fold cross validation with a time series split in training each potential model).

                    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                     <p><u>Evaluation Metrics</u><br>
						 There are many ways to determine how a machine learning model performs. For the H2KnOw model, our main metric was the F1 score. The F1 score is a balance between precision and recall, which are two other important metrics. Precision measures the proportion of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) to all positive predictions. In practical terms it gives us a measure of how confident the model is in making its prediction. Recall, measures the proportion of true positives to all actual positive instances in the dataset. This is a good indicator of how well our model is able to predict the right class. Below are the formulas used to calculate the F1-score, precision and recall:<br>
					 <img src="{% static '/img/precision.png'%}" class="img-fluid" alt=""> <br>
					 <img src="{% static '/img/recall.png'%}" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
					 <img src="{% static '/img/f1.png'%}" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
					 <br>
					 Additionally the below confusion matrix visualizes the relationship between true/false positive/negatives: <br>
					 <img src="{% static '/img/pos-neg-types.png'%}" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br>
					 <em>True Positive:</em> Model correctly predicts a functional water point<br>
					 <em>True Negative:</em> Model correctly predicts a non-functional water point<br>
	 				 <em>False Positive:</em> Model predicts a water point as functional, when it is actually non-functional<br>
					 <em>False Negative:</em> Model predicts a water point as non-functional, when it is actually functional<br>
					 <br>
					 In addition to the F-1 score, we also looked at accuracy to ensure that the model was making correct predictions. The formula for accuracy is as follows: Accuracy = TP + TN / (TP + TN + FP + FN)<br>
					 <br>
					 <u>Model Evaluation</u><br>
					 Before developing our final model, we established some baselines to serve as a reference for comparison. Our first baseline was based on random guess; i.e. what the probability of a water point being functional is in our training set; this was 58%. Our second baseline was a simple decision tree which had an improved accuracy of 74% and an F1-score of 2%. So while the decision tree had a higher accuracy than the random guess, it had a very weak F-1 score (closer to 100% is ideal) indicating that it was having significant difficulties in correctly classifying the water points. <br>
					 <br>
					 The final model outperformed both baselines with an accuracy of 98% and F-1 score of 89%, showing that this model was able to effectively distinguish between functioning and nonfunctioning water points.<br>
					 <br>
					 The original WPdx dataset has one observation for a single waterpoint. There is a column in the dataset that has historical data for a portion of the dataset. After retrieving data from the historical data column, we can split the training and testing datasets for the machine learning model by year i.e. 2005-2020 for training and 2021 for testing. This particular split is what occurred in the final model giving us the results listed above.<br>
					 <br>
					 The features that were the most predictive included: staleness score (i.e. how old the latest water point observation is), longitude, latitude, installation year, proximity to roads and urban areas, pressure score, crucialness score, and the log gross national income per capita in 1,000 USD (2011 PPP). The pressure (0-100%) score gives a measure of the capacity the water point is functioning at, while the crucialness score (0-100%) is a measure of how important the water point is in a 1km radius; more water points in the 1km radius will lead to a lower score. More information about these scores can be found on the WPdx data guide<sup><a href="https://www.waterpointdata.org/docs/WPdx_User_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.

        </div>
        <p>
          H2knOw is passionate about utilizing cutting-edge technology to address critical water access challenges around the world. Our tool represents a crucial step towards this mission, but it is important to note that the current version is a prototype. As such, we must emphasize that the results generated by the app should not be used as a primary or sole source for individuals or communities seeking information about water accessibility just yet. It will require further steps to take this into production, as described in the Moving Forward section.

          <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
		  The H2knOw team hopes that this proof of concept can help water stressed and water scarce communities access safe water. By working together with organizations such as WPdx, NGO actors (e.g. Water Sanitation and Hygiene Global and National Cluster Coordination Groups), international organizations, and government actors who have developed relationships with local populations, H2knOw is confident it can take this proof of concept into production.<br>
		  <br>
		  The immediate next step would be to partner with one of the organizations mentioned above in a single country and focus on working with the partner to collect and obtain more granular contextual data, and more up to date water point observations. This would be followed by monitoring the data to see when population behavior will return to how it was pre-pandemic. Once this has been achieved, we would be able to retrain the model, and roll out a pilot version of the application. Depending on how often H2knOw would be able to access new data, the model would have to be updated and maintained accordingly.<br> 	  
		  <br>
		  In the future, H2knOw would like to expand this model to other countries, expand the timeline of the working model, and predict with greater confidence at what point in time a water point’s functionality may change. Working with partners to update water point observations and get more granular contextual data will be key in achieving this goal. Another method will be to work with partner organizations to better streamline data collection processes (e.g. provide QR codes at water points that could be used to crowdsource status updates from the public)

                Primarily local populations in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Uganda who are looking for nearby functioning water sources. The current prototype is not appropriate for water management by local actors. H2knOw looks forward to supporting local actors with a future version of the tool with predicted waterpoint functionality status, other pertinent waterpoint information, and functionality forecasts.

                WPdx requires a “status” for each waterpoint observation uploaded to their platform. WPdx <a href="https://www.waterpointdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WPdx-Cleaning-and-Categorization-Processes.pdf">standardizes</a> the various statuses into key terms. H2knOw further standardizes the status by mapping:
				<br>
				&emsp;Functional = 'Functional', 'Functional, needs repair', 'Functional, not in use'
				<br>
				&emsp;Non-Functional = 'Non-Functional', 'Abandoned/Decommissioned', 'Non-Functional, dry season'

                XGBoost is known to handle null values well, speed (thanks to parallel processing), is robust to multicollinearity, high accuracy, includes measures for regularization to help the model perform better on unseen data, and can scale up easily.

				Since the H2knOw model is a proof of concept, 2021 was withheld from the training of the model in order to prove that in the subsequent years, this model can predict on the new data that WPdx will input. Even though our WPdx data goes up until 2023, we choose to cap our data at 2021 since our secondary data sources only extend to 2021.
